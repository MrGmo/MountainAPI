# mountainAPI

Hi there!

This repo holds a simple mountain API. When called it will return the location, elevation, and first ascent of each of the Seven Summits (the highest mountain on each continent) in the world.

Link, deployed to heroku: https://simple-mountainapi.herokuapp.com/

Tech used:
HTML and Javascript

The API is built using express, cors, and fetch wrapped in a async await function. You can create a simple front end which just takes the name of one of the seven summits (ex: Aconcagua, Kilimanjaro,...) and it will yield the above information. 


Optimizations:

I should have included a simple front end to add to this, but I quickly moved on to other projects. You can test it on postman if you don't want to build a frontend as well.


Lessons Learned:

This project taught me how I can create my very own API and not just consume other API's that are on the internet. You can effectively create an API for anything you want and that is pretty cool.
